For my homework project, I have incorporated all of the required features as well as two other features for the hero. One feature is available on the Details Screen and the user is able to buy a potion to heal after hard battles. Instead of taking a certain amount of points from the hero, I decided to only take half of the heros current health if they had a failure of a battle. I also decided to make an array of images to be randomly selected from the Adventure Screen to be passed into the Details Screen after each battle. The other feature is on the Adventure Screen. This particular feature displays a battle image along with other battle information as well. In order to accomplish this I imported all of my images into the screen and stored them in an array. The array randomly selects and image and displays it on the Adventure Screen.
